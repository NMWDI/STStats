In this tutorial we will discuss the JSON schemas used to validate NMWDI data. This validation process provides a
quality assurance to the data and ensures that it conforms to the NMWDI specification. The consistency of the data
because of conformance to a specification greatly enhances the FAIR-ness of the data.
